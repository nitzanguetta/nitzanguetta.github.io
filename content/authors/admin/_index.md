I am a PhD candidate in [The Hebrew University of Jeruslaem, Israel](http://www.huji.ac.il/), under the supervision of [Dr. Roy Shwartz](https://schwartz-lab-huji.github.io/) and [Dr. Gabriel Stanovsky](https://gabrielstanovsky.github.io/).

The goal of my research is to improve vision and language generalization. Specifically, I aim to develop models with better compositionality abilities, less biased and better perform on real-world examples. See my publications for more details. 

I did my MSc withÂ [Prof. Michael Elhadad](http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elhadad) and [Prof. Eitan Bachmat](http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~ebachmat/), at the Ben Gurion University.
